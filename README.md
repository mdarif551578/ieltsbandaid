## About The Project

IELTS BandAid is a free, open-source web application designed to help IELTS candidates improve their writing skills. It leverages the power of generative AI to provide an in-depth evaluation of IELTS Writing Task 1 (Academic & General) and Task 2 essays.

Users can either type their essays directly or upload images of their handwritten work. The application then returns a comprehensive report, including an estimated overall band score, a breakdown across the four official marking criteria, and actionable recommendations for improvement.

The goal of this project is to democratize IELTS preparation by providing every student with an accessible, on-demand writing tutor.
